            <h2>explore together</h2>
            <p>for centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. where do we
                come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework
                for exploring and understanding our place in this world.</p>
            <p>discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time. You
                can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn`t survive, including our woolly mammoth,
                the dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>

            <h2>cosmology</h2>
            <p>explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, "the Sky Above Us", explores the night sky
                and
                what we can see and know about the universe around us. We`ll locate the various constellations and
                galaxies
                that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.</p>
            <p>follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early arab traders, to Galileo`s telescope, to the
                latest
                exploration of the planets in our solar system.</p>

            <h2>energetica exhibition on loan</h2>
            <p>on loan from the nemo science museum in amsterdam, the energetica exhibition is coming to the
                community
                science museum. It`s a series of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the
                elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to "wind island" that shows how
                turbines are able to use and control wind to create power.</p>

            <h2>biology and medicine</h2>
            <p>from micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights
                into the great wonders of the tiny world.</p>
            <p>for many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to
                the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of
                medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first
                heart transplant.</p>
            <p>many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals
                in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>
